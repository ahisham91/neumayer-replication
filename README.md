The research question in this study explores whether rehabilitation and reconstruction activities carried out in the aftermath of a natural disaster, can cause recovery of GDP growth in the short and long term to pre-disaster growth rates, or whether recovery of GDP growth to pre-disaster levels is not possible. This question is significant particularly in context of the increased frequency of natural disasters due to anthropogenic climate change, which also makes it necessary to ascertain the predicted future frequency of natural disasters, and the policy level interventions required to manage their fallout. For consistency of 
analysis, this study focuses exclusively on the Southeast Asian state of Indonesia. To answer the research question, data from the study “The impact of the Indian Ocean tsunami on Aceh’s long-term Economic Growth” (Neumayer et al, 2019) is used and the findings of the study are replicated.
